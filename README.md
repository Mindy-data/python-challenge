# python-challenge

The assignment is to take 2 csv files and analyze their contents. 
We started by creating a file system to organize our information, for each data set we have creates a resources file which is where we save our csv and another with the data file name (pypoll or pybank) in these files we store our pything code, for me I wrote in VS code and saved a .py file. There is also a txt file that is written from executing our code, my tutor helped me set this up and I used the same format to write a txt file for both data sets. 

To analyze the data we used what we learned in our activivities to create for loops to read our data row by row, then (with a lot of help! from tutors and askBCS) I was able to capture the values I was coding for. 

My tutor also helped me set up a clean and efficient way to "print." I created a variable named output, I put all of my print stetements as f' strings to write out the answers I was seeking. I expected this to be the easiest part of the assignment, howver, I had to get some additional assistance with my pypoll print statements, my calculations are coming out correct but my information is not displaying in the same format as the sample given.
